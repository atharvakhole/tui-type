## Overview

This is the repository for my ongoing blog series, [Building a TUI Application in Rust](https://cone-frog.dev/posts/Building-a-MonkeyType-TUI-in-Rust/), where I build a clone of the popular typing website [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com).

MonkeyType is a popular website for practicing touch-typing, with a simple but visually pleasing look. It has multiple test modes, provides analysis and statistics about your typing, has great themes, and a lot more features.

### Goal

The primary goal is to learn something new. I hope to get better at Rust as well as programming in general by the end of this project, while also helping any readers along the way.

#### Features to Implement
- Type what you see, see what you type
- Live errors, wpm and accuracy displays
- Variety of test lengths and test modes
- Performance stats and analysis
- (some) theming options

## My process
